    "A perceptron is based on a *threshold logic unit (TLU)*. A TLU has at least one input and exactly one output.\n",

    "\"The inputs and outputs are numbers, and each input connection is associated with a weight.\" The weights are very important and are used to train / teach the network.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The TLU computes a weighted sum of its inputs ($z = w_1*x_1 + w_2*x_2 + ... + w_n*x_n = x^T * w$). Then it applies a *step function* to that sum and outputs the result: $h_w (x) = step (x^T * w)$. $h$ stands for  hypothesis or prediction.\n",
